# JobExel Documentation

## Introduction
JobExel is an integrated, AI-powered digital ecosystem designed to enhance career and startup development. This document outlines the technical and user-centric design principles for building JobExel, focusing on clarity, scalability, and usability.

## User Roles & Permissions
### User Types
- **Job Seekers**: Primary users with access to job search tools, resume builders, and skill assessments.
- **Recruiters/Employers**: Access to candidate pipelines, job posting tools, and analytics.
- **Admins**: Full system access (user management, billing, compliance).
- **Organizations**: Companies can manage team access (e.g., HR teams with tiered permissions).

### Permissions & Access
- **Job Seekers**: Read/write personal data; no access to recruiter tools.
- **Recruiters**: Read/write job postings; view anonymized candidate pools (compliance with GDPR/CCPA).
- **Admins**: Full CRUD access; audit logs.
- **Company-Level Access**: Teams can share job postings/dashboards (e.g., "HR Manager" vs. "Hiring Team Member").

**Best Practice**: Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** with granular permissions.

## Integration Requirements
- **Job Boards**: Prioritize **Indeed**, **LinkedIn Jobs**, **Glassdoor**, and **niche boards** (e.g., **Dice** for tech).
- **Resume Parsing**: Use **Sovren** or **Affinda** (high accuracy, multilingual support).
- **ATS Integration**: **Greenhouse**, **Lever**, and **Workday** (offer webhook/API compatibility).
- **LinkedIn Integration**: Basic profile import via OAuth; advanced sharing of JobExel activity.

**Best Practice**: Use **OAuth 2.0** for secure third-party logins.

## AI Feature Specifics
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for AI suggestions; use caching for common queries.
- **AI Models**: GPT-4 for resume/CV parsing, BERT for job description analysis.
- **Budget & API Limits**: Start with pay-as-you-go and monitor usage.
- **Offline Functionality**: Core features should work offline with local storage sync.

**Best Practice**: Use **hybrid AI** (cloud + edge) for latency-sensitive tasks.

## Data Retention & Privacy
- **Retention Policy**: Retain active user data indefinitely; anonymize inactive accounts after 2 years.
- **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and PIPEDA.
- **Data Deletion**: Allow self-service deletion; retain backups for 30 days.
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for stored data; TLS 1.3 for transit.

**Best Practice**: Provide a transparency dashboard showing data usage.

## Scale & Performance
- **Growth Rate**: Plan for 10x monthly growth with auto-scaling cloud infrastructure.
- **Peak Times**: Weekday mornings and post-holiday seasons.
- **Storage**: ~50MB/user.
- **Regional Benchmarks**: <1s latency for static content; <3s for dynamic content.

**Best Practice**: Use AWS/GCP with Kubernetes for scalability.

## Business Logic
- **Job Lifecycle**: Posting → Application → Screening → Interview → Offer/Rejection.
- **Duplicate Applications**: Block duplicates via user_id + job_id checks.
- **Job Matching**: Skills (70%), experience (20%), location/preferences (10%).
- **Expired Jobs**: Auto-archive after 60 days; allow reposting.

**Best Practice**: Use event-driven architecture for lifecycle tracking.

## User Experience
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Languages**: English + Spanish; use i18n frameworks.
- **Mobile/Desktop Ratio**: Optimize for 60% mobile.
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Safari, Firefox (latest 2 versions).

**Best Practice**: Use responsive design frameworks.

## Monitoring & Analytics
- **Key Metrics**: Conversion rate, job offer rate, DAU/MAU.
- **Reporting**: Pre-built dashboards for admins.
- **Activity Tracking**: Track feature usage.
- **Analytics Tools**: Mixpanel and Google Analytics.

**Best Practice**: Anonymize tracking data for compliance.

## Backup & Recovery
- **RPO**: ≤1 hour; **RTO**: ≤4 hours.
- **Service Degradation**: Fallback to read-only mode.

**Best Practice**: Use multi-region backups.

## Monetization & Billing
- **Subscription Tiers**: Free, Pro, Team.
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe/PayPal.
- **Premium Features**: AI resume reviews, priority job matches.
- **Trials**: 14-day free Pro tier.

**Best Practice**: Offer prorated refunds for annual plans.

## API & External Access
- **Public API**: RESTful API with OAuth 2.0.
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute for free tier.
- **Versioning**: Use URL versioning.

**Best Practice**: Provide Swagger/OpenAPI docs.

## Content Management
- **Resume Templates**: Customization with drag-and-drop editors.
- **CMS**: Use Strapi for career resources.
- **Moderation**: Auto-flag inappropriate content.

**Best Practice**: Version control for templates.

## Notification System
- **Types**: Email, push, in-app.
- **Customization**: User preferences for frequency/channel.
- **SLAs**: Critical notifications within 1 minute.

**Best Practice**: Use Amazon SNS or Twilio for delivery.

## Testing Requirements
- **Coverage**: 80% unit test coverage.
- **A/B Testing**: Use Optimizely.
- **Automation**: End-to-end tests with Cypress.

**Best Practice**: Shift-left testing.

## Deployment & DevOps
- **Strategy**: Blue-green deployments.
- **Compliance**: SOC 2.
- **Frequency**: Weekly deployments.

**Best Practice**: Use GitOps for Kubernetes.

## Security & Audits
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly audits.
- **Bug Bounties**: Public program.

**Best Practice**: OWASP Top 10 compliance.

## Localization
- **Languages**: Use i18next for translations.
- **Regions**: Localize job boards.

**Best Practice**: Hire native speakers for translations.

## Final Recommendations
1. Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focusing on job seekers and core AI features.
2. Use serverless architecture (AWS Lambda) to minimize upfront costs.
3. Prioritize user onboarding and accessibility to drive retention.
